I remember sitting at that table as a child, watching her arrange the blooms with careful hands, humming softly under her breath.\nWhen she passed, the vase was one of the few things I brought back from her home. Every time I see it, I feel her presence, as if she’s still here, tending to her flowers and offering quiet words of encouragement. Now, it sits in my living room, not always with flowers, but always with love—a piece of her that makes every place feel like home.",
